# Airport Lookup - Example Go Project using Tarmac

This project is a Work in Progress. It is not ready for use and you may find many pushes directly to main, lots of bugs, and very little testing/documentation.

## What is this?

This is an example Go project using [Tarmac](https://github.com/tarmacproject/tarmac) to build an application that provides an Airport lookup API.

Tarmac is a new approach to building applications using Web Assembly (WASM). Tarmac acts as an application framework that lets you focus more on the business logic of your application and less on the infrastructure and boilerplate code.

This project is meant to serve as a practical example of how to use Tarmac to build a real application. Including testing, running locally, leveraging external services, observability, and more.
